Claude Code writes a detailed record of every session to `~/.claude/projects`.
Check Your Agent turns that record into estimated API-equivalent cost, observed
activity, and supported findings with evidence receipts. The app runs locally:
no accounts, no telemetry, no external calls, and the raw logs are never
modified. Tools like ccusage tell you *what* you used; Check Your Agent helps
you investigate *why* a session was expensive or unusual.

## Quick start

With `uv` (or `pipx`) installed:

```bash
uvx checkyouragent          # or: pipx run checkyouragent
```

This serves the app on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, opens your browser, and uses
`~/.claude/projects` as the import root when it exists, otherwise `./Data`. No
exports handy? Add `--demo` to explore a bundled, fully synthetic dataset that
exercises every screen (the Import screen also offers **Load demo data** when
the cache is empty).

```bash
uvx checkyouragent --demo
uvx checkyouragent --import-root /path/to/exports
uvx checkyouragent --port 8123 --no-browser
```

The examples use `uvx`; replace `uvx` with `pipx run` if you prefer pipx. For a
persistent command, run `uv tool install checkyouragent` (or
`pipx install checkyouragent`). A persistent install also provides the shorter
`cya` alias, which behaves identically to `checkyouragent`.

In the app, open **Import** and choose **Sync new and updated**, use
**Sessions** to find sessions worth a closer look, open one to inspect its
timeline, trace, subagents, and supported findings, then use **Cost** and
**Explore** for the aggregate views.

## What it does

- **Import** synchronizes Claude Code project folders from a read-only export
  root into a rebuildable SQLite index. Re-importing a changed project rebuilds
  it from source.
- **Sessions** is an investigation board: supported findings, observed errors,
  subagent fanout, event volume, duration, and estimated cost, with search,
  filters, and sorting.
- The **session workspace** shows an event timeline with trace lanes, tool
  activity, a subagent heatmap, in-session search, supported findings with
  evidence receipts, and a raw event inspector.
- **Cost** breaks estimated API-equivalent cost down by project, model, and
  token category, with a cost-over-time chart, spike detection, turn
  distribution, and session outliers. Historical pricing is optional and
  date-aware.
- **Explore** covers limit hits, context economics, and usage drivers, plus an
  experimental section with the Usage Mindmap and subgroup discovery.
- **Team bundles** export allowlisted aggregates (no raw conversation content)
  that teammates can import for team Overview and Cost views. A privacy mode
  reduces visible sensitive text.

> [!NOTE]
> This is early-stage software. Costs are estimates computed from recorded
> tokens and bundled pricing tables, not invoice amounts, and the UI
> distinguishes values that are observed, estimated, inferred, or associated.
> Experimental views report classified activity and statistical associations,
> not causes. Privacy mode reduces visible sensitive text but is not data
> sanitization; review screenshots before sharing them.

### Investigate one session

Follow the event timeline, compare trace lanes, inspect subagents, and open the
recorded evidence behind supported findings.

### Understand cost

Break estimated API-equivalent cost down by project, model, token category, and
time, then drill into unusual sessions and turns.

### Explore context economics

Review estimated context opportunity, the assumptions behind it, and the
sessions and receipts that support each signal.

More screens - including import, subgroup discovery, and cost-outlier
drilldown - are in [`docs/screenshots/`](docs/screenshots).

## How it compares

Check Your Agent is not the only way to look at Claude Code usage.

| Tool | Best for | Trade-off vs Check Your Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ccusage](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage) | Fast daily, monthly, and session usage/cost reports across coding-agent CLIs | Descriptive accounting rather than evidence-backed session investigation |
| [token-dashboard](https://github.com/nateherkai/token-dashboard) | Per-prompt cost analytics, tool/file heatmaps, cache analytics, and rule-based tips | Focuses on prompt-level hotspots and tips rather than supported findings with evidence receipts and context-carry attribution |
| [Sniffly](https://github.com/chiphuyen/sniffly) | Usage patterns, error breakdowns, message history, and optional sharing | Less focused on API-equivalent cost drivers and evidence-backed session investigation |
| [Anthropic native analytics](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/analytics) | Organization usage, spend, and adoption for Team/Enterprise and Console customers | Aggregate service-side reporting rather than local raw-session investigation |
| **Check Your Agent** | Deep local forensics: which sessions merit investigation, with observed activity, estimated cost, and receipts | Claude Code only; runs a local web app rather than printing a terminal report |

Reach for `ccusage` when you want a number in ten seconds; reach for Check Your
Agent when you want to know *why* the number is what it is and what to change.

## Other ways to run

### Docker

Prerequisite: Docker with Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TarekAwwad/checkyouragent
cd checkyouragent
docker compose up --build
```

Before starting, copy the project folders from `~/.claude/projects` into
`./Data`, or edit the `./Data:/imports:ro` Compose mount to point directly at
your Claude Code projects directory. The same commands work unchanged in
Windows PowerShell.

The frontend is at `http://localhost:5173` and backend API docs at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`, both bound to host loopback. Compose mounts the
configured import directory read-only, `./TeamBundles` for bundle exchange, and
the pricing files, and keeps the SQLite cache in a named `ccfr-data` volume, so
avoid `docker compose down -v` unless you mean to delete that cache.

### From source

Prerequisites: Python 3.11 or newer, `uv`, Node.js 20 or newer.

Run the backend and frontend in separate terminals, starting each one from the
repository root.

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv run uvicorn ccfr.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

To run the backend tests, use `uv run --extra dev pytest` from `backend/`.

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174`. The dev server proxies `/api` to
`http://localhost:8000`, so leave `VITE_API_BASE` unset during development. To
serve the built UI from the Python package instead, build it first with
`python scripts/build_webui.py`.

## Configuration

Source-checkout defaults resolve from the repository root. Installed
(`uvx`/`pipx`) runs keep writable state under `~/.checkyouragent/` and read the
baseline price table bundled with the package.

| Variable | Source checkout | Installed run | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CCFR_DATA_DIR` | `<repo>/.ccfr-data` | `~/.checkyouragent` | SQLite cache, settings, team bundles |
| `CCFR_DB_PATH` | `<repo>/.ccfr-data/ccfr.sqlite3` | `~/.checkyouragent/ccfr.sqlite3` | SQLite database file |
| `CCFR_IMPORT_ROOT` | `<repo>/Data` | `~/.claude/projects` when present, otherwise `./Data` | Root scanned for Claude Code project folders |
| `CCFR_TEAM_BUNDLE_ROOT` | `<repo>/.ccfr-data/team-bundles` | `~/.checkyouragent/team-bundles` | Team bundle export/import root |
| `CCFR_PRICING_PATH` | `<repo>/pricing.csv` | Bundled `pricing.csv` | Baseline price table |
| `CCFR_PRICING_DIR` | `<repo>/pricing` | `~/.checkyouragent/pricing` | Optional dated pricing snapshots |

The import root should look like Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects`: one folder
per project containing `<session-id>.jsonl` files, with optional per-session
subagent logs and tool results. The UI path field can select the configured
import root or a descendant; requests outside it are rejected. **Reset local
data** on the Import screen clears imported sessions while keeping settings and
imported team bundles.

`pricing.csv` holds baseline prices in US dollars per million tokens, and the
optional `pricing/` directory holds dated snapshots (`pricing-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)
used by historical pricing mode. Models without a price row are labeled as
partially priced rather than silently counted as zero.

The full configuration reference, data layout, and import behavior are in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Limitations

- Ingestion is Claude Code `.claude/projects` JSONL only. It does not read
  Codex, OpenAI, or other agent histories.
- It is not a live integration. It reads the import root when you run an
  import, and it keeps no durable archive of sessions that disappear from the
  source export.
- Team views are aggregate-only by design. Bundles omit raw session detail, so
  team scope has no per-session drilldown.
- The backend is unauthenticated and intended for loopback use only. Do not
  expose it to a network; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
