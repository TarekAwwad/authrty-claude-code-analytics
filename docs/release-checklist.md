# Release Checklist

Use this checklist before creating or publishing a GitHub release. The release
workflow publishes to PyPI when the GitHub release is published, so every item
below must be complete first.

## Scope and Metadata

- [ ] The release commit is on `main` and the working tree is clean.
- [ ] `backend/pyproject.toml`, `frontend/package.json`, and
  `frontend/package-lock.json` contain the same version.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a dated section for that version and no release work is
  left only under `Unreleased`.
- [ ] Documentation, screenshots, and demo media describe the release behavior.
- [ ] License files, project links, and package metadata are current.

## Security and Privacy

- [ ] Review changes to imports, paths, raw JSON, Team bundles, persistence,
  browser-origin controls, and network binding.
- [ ] Search tracked files for credentials, tokens, private paths, and raw user
  exports.
- [ ] Run `uv run --locked --with pip-audit pip-audit` from `backend/`.
- [ ] Run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` from `frontend/`.
- [ ] Confirm synthetic fixtures and screenshots contain no private data.

## Verification

- [ ] Backend tests pass on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- [ ] Frontend build and tests pass from a clean `npm ci --ignore-scripts`.
- [ ] `docker compose config -q` passes.
- [ ] `git diff --check` reports no whitespace errors.
- [ ] CI's package smoke job builds the sdist and wheel, verifies bundled UI and
  data assets, installs the wheel, and reads its packaged version/assets.
- [ ] Test the installed CLI from the candidate wheel on loopback.

## Publish

- [ ] Create tag `vX.Y.Z` only after all required CI checks pass.
- [ ] Create and review the GitHub release notes before publishing the release.
- [ ] After publication, verify the PyPI files and run a fresh
  `uvx checkyouragent@X.Y.Z --help` smoke test.
