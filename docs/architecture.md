# Architecture

Audit date: 2026-08-16.

Check Your Agent is a local FastAPI and React application over a rebuildable
SQLite cache. The current importer supports Claude Code project exports. The
application reads source exports but never modifies them.

## Runtime Topology

```text
Claude Code project export root
        |
        v
backend/src/ccfr/ingest/importer.py
        |
        v
rebuildable local SQLite cache <------ imported team-bundle JSON
        |                                      |
        +--> backend/src/ccfr/analysis/* <------+
        |
        v
backend/src/ccfr/api/routes.py  (/api)
        |
        v
frontend/src/App.tsx
```

The supported runtime shapes are:

- Installed package: `checkyouragent` (or `cya`) defaults to `serve`, starts
  Uvicorn on `127.0.0.1:8000`, and serves the bundled React application and API
  from the same process.
- Source development: FastAPI runs on port `8000`; Vite runs on port `5174`
  and proxies `/api` to FastAPI.
- Docker Compose: the backend is exposed on loopback port `8000`; a separately
  built nginx frontend is exposed on loopback port `5173`.

Backend entry points are `ccfr.main:app` for ASGI and `ccfr.cli:main` for the
command line. The backend uses FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, and SQLite in WAL
mode. The frontend uses React 18, Vite, and TanStack Query.

## Storage Model

The SQLite database is a disposable index, not an archive.

Local import tables:

- Import and source identity: `imports`, `projects`, `sessions`,
  `import_errors`.
- Parsed source records: `events`, `messages`, `content_blocks`, `tool_calls`,
  `tool_results`, `persisted_outputs`, `subagents`.
- Derived records: `event_edges`, `session_stats`, `session_findings`,
  `analysis_metadata`, and the FTS5 `search_index` virtual table.

Team tables:

- `team_bundles` stores one imported bundle revision per member.
- `team_bundle_sessions` stores the bundle's sanitized session aggregates.

Database migration removes the retired `memory_nodes`, `event_features`,
`sequence_slices`, `risk_findings`, `pattern_hits`, and `sequence_patterns`
tables. They are not part of the current model.

`settings.json` lives under `CCFR_DATA_DIR`, outside SQLite, so a local-data
reset does not remove it. It stores the historical-pricing and privacy-mode
preferences, subscription plan history, the random local bundle identity and
export sequence, and team-export form preferences.

## Import and Rebuild Flow

The importer:

1. Treats each immediate child directory of `CCFR_IMPORT_ROOT` as one project.
2. Reads project-root `*.jsonl` session files.
3. Reads `subagents/agent-*.jsonl` and `agent-*.meta.json` inside UUID-named
   session directories.
4. Indexes metadata and the first-line preview of `tool-results/*.txt` files.
5. Parses events, messages, tool calls/results, token usage, and subagent data.
6. Rebuilds event edges, subagent/session statistics, full-text search rows,
   and evidence-backed session findings.

The project signature covers relative file paths, sizes, and modification
times. When it changes, that project's cache rows are deleted and rebuilt from
the source files currently present. A project that disappears from the source
tree is not automatically archived. The importer deliberately ignores project
`memory/` directories and removes the retired memory search index during
migration.

`POST /api/imports/reset` clears local imports and derived analytics while
preserving imported team bundles and `settings.json`. Team records have their
own reset and per-member removal routes.

## Team-Bundle Boundary

Team export uses an explicit allowlist in `analysis/team_bundles.py` and shared
canonicalizers in `analysis/bundle_sanitization.py`. New exports use schema v3;
the importer also accepts legacy schema v1 and v2 bundles. Implemented privacy
levels are:

- `structural`: no member/project display names and no tool/file labels.
- `team`: adds a member display name, project labels, real tool/MCP and
  subagent-type names with counts, and extension-only file-type mix.

The reserved `sessions` and `raw` levels are rejected. Imported bundles contain
aggregates rather than raw events, so Team scope has no session drilldown.
Content omission reduces disclosure but exact dates, token counts, and other
structural aggregates can still fingerprint activity.

The same bundle builder is used by the web API and the headless
`checkyouragent export-bundle` command.

## API Surface

All application routes use the `/api` prefix.

- Runtime and settings: `GET /config`, `GET /settings`, `PUT /settings`.
- Local import/cache: `POST /imports`, `POST /imports/demo`,
  `POST /imports/reset`, `GET /source/projects`, `GET /imports`,
  `GET /imports/progress`, `GET /stats`.
- Local records: `GET /projects`, `GET /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`,
  `GET /events/{id}`, and `GET /search`.
- Session detail: `GET /sessions/{id}/timeline`, `/trace`, `/turn-costs`,
  `/subagents`, `/tool-activity`, `/findings`, and `/context-economics`.
- Local analytics: `GET /analytics/cost`, `/discovery`,
  `/context-economics`, `/usage-map`, `/usage-map/evidence`,
  `/usage-characteristics`, and `/limits`.
- Team export/import: `GET /team/projects`, `POST /team/export-preview`,
  `POST /team/export`, `POST /team/import`, `POST /team/import-bundle`,
  `GET /team/imports`, `DELETE /team/members/{member_id}`, and
  `POST /team/reset`.
- Team analytics: `GET /team/dashboard` and `/team/analytics/cost`.

There are no current contribution-bundle API routes.

## Frontend Navigation

The sidebar switches between two data scopes.

This machine:

- **Import**: discover, import, refresh, or reset local project data; load the
  bundled synthetic demo.
- **Export**: preview and write a privacy-controlled team bundle.
- **Sessions**: filter and sort sessions by observed evidence, activity, and
  estimated API-equivalent cost.
- **Cost**: local cost and token analytics.
- **Explore**: **Limit hits**, **Context economics**, **Usage drivers**,
  experimental **Usage Mindmap**, and experimental **Subgroups**.
- **Session workspace**: a drilldown reached from Sessions, Cost, or Explore;
  it combines summary metrics, subagent/tool activity, trace, timeline, search,
  supported findings, and event inspection.

Team:

- **Import**: import, list, and remove team bundles.
- **Overview**: aggregate team/member activity.
- **Cost**: aggregate bundle cost; no raw-session panels.

The shell also provides privacy-mode display blur, theme controls, a collapsible
sidebar, and a glossary. Privacy mode changes presentation only; it does not
sanitize the underlying cache or API responses.

## Analysis Modules

- `pricing.py`: baseline and dated-snapshot price timelines and token-category
  cost estimation.
- `cost_trends.py`: shared daily/weekly trend bucketing for local and team cost.
- `session_findings.py`: import-time, evidence-backed finding receipts.
- `trace.py` and `metrics.py`: trace lanes/spans and neutral same-tool streak
  display metadata.
- `discovery.py`: corpus subgroup associations with support and uncertainty
  gates.
- `context_economics.py`: estimated context-carry attribution and opportunity
  detectors.
- `usage_map.py`: deterministic classification of observed assistant activity
  into workflow phases and neutral observations.
- `usage_characteristics.py`: independent, overlapping usage-driver shares.
- `limits.py`: corpus-wide recorded subscription-limit hits and reconstructed
  five-hour usage windows.
- `team_bundles.py`, `bundle_sanitization.py`, and `team_cost.py`: privacy-level
  bundle export/import, canonicalization, team aggregation, and cost analytics.

The former `risk_patterns.py` and contribution analysis modules are no longer
part of the current implementation.

## Configuration Reference

Important environment variables:

```text
CCFR_DATA_DIR=<source checkout>/.ccfr-data
CCFR_DB_PATH=<CCFR_DATA_DIR>/ccfr.sqlite3
CCFR_IMPORT_ROOT=<source checkout>/Data
CCFR_DEMO_DIR=<source checkout>/demo/claude-export
CCFR_TEAM_BUNDLE_ROOT=<CCFR_DATA_DIR>/team-bundles
CCFR_PRICING_PATH=<source checkout>/pricing.csv
CCFR_PRICING_DIR=<source checkout>/pricing
CCFR_WEBUI_DIR=<installed package>/ccfr/webui
CCFR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
CCFR_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

These are source-checkout defaults. An installed package defaults
`CCFR_DATA_DIR` to `~/.checkyouragent`; `serve` prefers
`~/.claude/projects` as its import root when that directory exists, then falls
back to `./Data`. Explicit environment variables and CLI flags take precedence.

## Security Boundary

The supported deployment assumes a trusted local user:

- The API has no authentication. Normal startup and Docker bind it to loopback.
- `TrustedHostMiddleware` rejects unexpected `Host` headers by default to
  reduce DNS-rebinding exposure. A deliberate non-loopback `serve --host`
  disables that allowlist unless `CCFR_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set explicitly.
- CORS restricts browser response access. A separate request guard rejects
  state-changing requests from untrusted browser origins or cross-site Fetch
  Metadata while allowing same-origin, configured development origins, and
  non-browser clients. API request bodies are capped at 50 MiB.
- Raw exports and the derived cache contain prompts, responses, commands,
  paths, tool data, and other potentially sensitive content.
- The Team bundle allowlist is designed to omit raw content but still exposes
  structural aggregates and, at the `team` level, selected labels. Imports
  require canonical dates, bound numeric values, at most 50,000 sessions, and
  the global API body limit; see `PRIVACY.md`.
- Cost trend responses are capped at 3,660 daily or weekly buckets.

Do not expose the application to a LAN or the public internet without adding
authentication, request-forgery protection, transport security, and a review of
the intended disclosure boundary.
