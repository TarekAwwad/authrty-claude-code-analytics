# Documentation Audit

Audit date: 2026-08-10.

This is a dated repository snapshot, not a promise that documentation will stay
current automatically. It records the public documentation and release-hardening
pass for the 0.2.0 candidate. Product claims were checked against the backend
schema and routes, importer, analysis modules, frontend navigation, package
metadata, and runtime configuration at that date.

## Status Summary

The public text now describes the current product model:

- local Claude Code import into a rebuildable cache, not a durable archive;
- a Sessions investigation board rather than a risk-ranked Overview;
- supported findings tied to recorded evidence rather than opaque scores;
- observed, estimated, inferred, and associated values labelled by basis;
- Team bundle schema v3 without retired risk, loop, sequence, or memory fields;
- separate local-data and Team reset behavior;
- current Explore navigation and current package/Docker/development commands;
- an unauthenticated, loopback-oriented service with explicit browser-origin,
  request-size, and local-data sensitivity boundaries.

No public documentation should describe the repository as open source. It is
source-available under the Business Source License 1.1 and converts to
Apache-2.0 on the Change Date stated in `LICENSE`.

## Current Product Reality

### Runtime and data source

- Public product and Python package name: **Check Your Agent** /
  `checkyouragent`; internal Python namespace and environment-variable prefix:
  `ccfr` / `CCFR_`.
- Supported source: Claude Code `.claude/projects`-style exports only.
- The importer reads project-root session JSONL, UUID-session subagent JSONL and
  metadata, and persisted `tool-results/*.txt` metadata/previews.
- Project `memory/` directories may exist in the source but are intentionally
  ignored. The retired memory index is dropped during database migration.
- Raw source files are read-only. A changed project is rebuilt in SQLite from
  the files currently on disk; disappeared source data is not durably archived.
- The installed command is `checkyouragent` with the `cya` alias. With no
  subcommand both default to `serve` on loopback port `8000`.

### Current storage

- Core local tables are `imports`, `projects`, `sessions`, `events`, `messages`,
  `content_blocks`, `tool_calls`, `tool_results`, `persisted_outputs`,
  `subagents`, and `import_errors`.
- Derived local tables are `event_edges`, `session_stats`, `session_findings`,
  `analysis_metadata`, and the FTS5 `search_index`.
- Team imports use `team_bundles` and `team_bundle_sessions`.
- Risk-pattern, sequence-feature, loop-stat, and memory-index tables are retired
  and removed by migration.
- `settings.json` is outside SQLite and preserves display/pricing preferences,
  plan history, and Team export identity/preferences across a local-data reset.
- A local reset preserves imported Team rows. Team reset/removal is separate.
  Neither operation deletes original exports or already-written bundle files.

### Current navigation

This machine:

- Import
- Export
- Sessions
- Cost
- Explore: Limit hits, Context economics, Usage drivers, experimental Usage
  Mindmap, and experimental Subgroups
- Session workspace, reached as a drilldown rather than a permanent nav item

Team:

- Import
- Overview
- Cost

Team data has no raw event/session drilldown because bundles contain aggregates.

### Current analysis claims

- **Observed** values come directly from imported records or deterministic
  counts/classifications over those records.
- **Estimated** values include API-equivalent cost and context opportunity.
  They depend on local pricing and explicit detector assumptions; they are not
  invoices or guaranteed savings.
- **Inferred** limit windows reconstruct account-level five-hour periods from
  recorded usage and rate-limit notices. Missing notices or usage outside the
  exported Claude Code corpus remain invisible.
- **Associated** subgroup findings are non-causal statistical comparisons with
  declared samples, uncertainty, multiple-comparison correction, and example
  receipts.
- Supported session findings detect specific recorded conditions and link back
  to evidence. They do not recreate the removed risk score/tier system.
- Usage Mindmap classifies observed assistant activity; it does not allocate
  message cost to workflow phases.
- Usage Drivers entries overlap and therefore need not sum to 100%.

### Team bundles

- New exports use schema v3 and `structural` or `team` privacy levels.
- Schema v1 and v2 imports remain accepted, but deprecated risk, sequence, and
  loop fields are stripped before current persistence.
- `sessions` and `raw` privacy levels are reserved and rejected.
- The schema-v3 allowlist is designed to omit prompts, assistant text,
  reasoning, raw JSON, previews, commands, paths, branches, filenames, and tool
  input/output; incomplete date validation remains a documented exception risk.
- Structural aggregates can still fingerprint activity. Team-level bundles
  additionally disclose the selected member/project labels, tool mix,
  subagent-type mix, and file-extension mix.

## Removed or Obsolete Claims

These features or claims must not be presented as current:

- numeric risk scores, risk tiers, and a risk-ranked Overview board;
- loop/max-repeat metrics and the passive event-density chart;
- `risk_patterns.py`, sequence-pattern caches, or a shipped sequence-mining
  view;
- memory Markdown indexing or memory search;
- a contribution page, contribution API, or public contribution workflow;
- Team bundle risk categories, inferred patterns, or event sequences;
- cap-zone, percentile, near-miss, or plan-fit verdicts in Limit hits;
- causal subgroup conclusions, cost attribution by Usage Mindmap phase, or
  guaranteed Context Economics savings;
- Team raw-session sharing or Team session drilldowns;
- Codex/OpenAI/other-agent import, live hooks, OpenTelemetry ingestion, or a
  durable source-pruning archive.

## Supported Inputs and Outputs

Inputs:

- Claude Code project directories directly below `CCFR_IMPORT_ROOT`.
- Main-session and subagent JSONL, subagent metadata JSON, and persisted-output
  text files in the supported layout.
- Team bundle JSON schema v1, v2, or v3.
- A baseline pricing CSV and optional dated pricing snapshots.

Outputs:

- A rebuildable local SQLite cache containing sensitive parsed and derived
  records.
- Local `settings.json`.
- Team bundle JSON under `CCFR_TEAM_BUNDLE_ROOT/exports`, or a path chosen by
  the headless `export-bundle` command.
- Local browser dashboards and API JSON responses.
- Usage Mindmap JSON/PNG exports.

The retired contribution output directory is not a current output.

## Known Limitations That Documentation Must Preserve

- The database is not a durable archive. Re-import follows the current source
  tree.
- The backend is unauthenticated and intended for loopback use. Browser-origin
  and Fetch Metadata checks protect state-changing routes, but they are not
  authentication and non-browser clients with local access remain trusted.
- Local raw/derived data and evidence receipts may contain prompts, paths,
  commands, errors, tool arguments, or accidentally pasted credentials.
- Privacy mode is display-only and does not sanitize the database, API, or a
  screenshot automatically.
- Pricing may be missing or outdated. Dollar values are API-equivalent
  estimates, can be partial, and do not model subscription billing.
- Team bundle imports enforce canonical ISO dates, signed 64-bit numeric bounds,
  a 50,000-session limit, and a 50 MiB API body cap. These resource limits do
  not make bundle content trustworthy.
- Team bundle structural data can be identifying even without raw content.
- The app must not be exposed to a LAN or public network without authentication
  and additional request protections.
- The project is source-available, not OSI open source under its current
  license.

## Verification Evidence

Implementation inspected during this documentation pass:

- `backend/src/ccfr/storage/database.py` for schema, migrations, and reset sets;
- `backend/src/ccfr/ingest/importer.py` for accepted files and rebuild behavior;
- `backend/src/ccfr/api/routes.py` for the complete `/api` surface;
- `backend/src/ccfr/analysis/*` for current analysis and Team boundaries;
- `backend/src/ccfr/config.py`, `settings.py`, `main.py`, and `cli.py` for paths,
  runtime shapes, middleware, and command behavior;
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `shell/navConfig.ts`, and
  `discover/techniques.tsx` for mounted screens and navigation.

The most recent repository-wide verification was the 2026-08-10 0.2.0
release-readiness pass:

- backend: 529 tests passed on the local Python 3.12 environment;
- Ruff correctness checks passed;
- frontend: 326 tests passed from a clean temporary install;
- frontend production build passed;
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`: no reported vulnerabilities;
- `pip-audit`: no known vulnerabilities in the updated runtime environment;
- the 0.2.0 sdist and wheel built successfully, bundled the UI, pricing table,
  and synthetic demo, installed into a clean virtual environment, and reported
  the expected package version and assets.

CI now repeats backend tests on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 and performs the
package smoke path before release.

## Remaining Documentation Work

| Gap | Priority | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated Team bundle schema reference | medium | Privacy docs summarize disclosure, but integrators need a field-by-field v3 reference, versioning rules, validation limits, and legacy-import behavior. |
| Durable archive status/design | medium | The limitation is documented, but any future archive implementation needs a separate retention and deletion contract. |

## Audit Maintenance Rules

When implementation changes any route, table, import source, output, screen,
command, default path, privacy field, reset behavior, or security boundary:

1. Update the user-facing document that owns the behavior.
2. Update `docs/architecture.md` when the technical surface changes.
3. Add an `[Unreleased]` changelog entry for user-visible changes.
4. Refresh synthetic screenshots/demo media for visible UI changes.
5. Replace the date and re-verify this audit rather than labelling an old audit
   as current without inspection.
